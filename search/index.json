[{"content":"Objective The goal of this challenge was to perform reconnaissance, analyze files (steganography/strings), decode credentials, and exploit a weak access control to achieve privilege escalation.\nSolution Performing reconnaissance At first glance, the site contains only two tabs: Home and Login. The Home tab redirects to the Login tab. I inspected the HTML and the browser console, and nothing unusual appeared.\nTo test the login system, I started with a simple SQL Injection test: ' OR 1=1 --.\nThe system returned Incorrect username and/or password, suggesting there was no trivial SQL vulnerability in the login route.\nLooking more closely at the page, I noticed a small text on the logo:\nThis text pointed to a directory/file on the site that served an image.\nAnalyzing the image I downloaded the image and searched for readable strings (using strings). The image appeared to be a black background, but inside the strings I found data resembling encoded credentials.\nReturning to the login page, I tried the credentials found and clicked login, but again received Incorrect username and/or password.\nLooking more carefully, it became clear that both the username and password were encoded in Base64 — a strong indicator being the = at the end.\nDecoding both using CyberChef, we get:\nUsername: bislacha Password: bislachamuitofoda12345 With the correct credentials, the login was now successful.\nAccess After logging in, a new tab called Members became available. There, I saw a list of current and former members; I focused on the authenticated user (Bislacha).\nInstead of the nickname, we can see another Base64 string; decoding it yields: panel.php.\nPanel.php Accessing /panel.php, I was informed that the account was logged in but not an admin. This indicates that an administrative panel exists and is protected by access control — meaning privilege escalation was likely possible.\nPrivilege escalation Inspecting the stored cookies, I found the fields login and user with their corresponding values. They were again Base64-encoded. Decoding them, we have:\nlogin: bislacha user: member Since the system stores user roles in Base64 and we need to escalate to admin, I replaced the current user value with YWRtaW4= (the Base64 for admin) and refreshed the page.\nAfter refreshing the page, the interface switched to the administrator version, and the challenge flag was displayed.\n","date":"2025-11-21T00:00:00Z","image":"https://kauamoreno.dev/p/the-return-of-bislacha/cover_hu_5b171f5fba6880b.jpg","permalink":"https://kauamoreno.dev/p/the-return-of-bislacha/","title":"The Return of Bislacha"},{"content":"Statement Do you know how to make a patch?\n👉 Click to download the patch file\nObjective The goal of this challenge was to locate and analyze the functions inside the patch file to identify the routine responsible for generating the flag.\nSolution Metadata I checked the binary’s metadata looking for hints or inconsistencies; I didn’t find anything relevant.\nReadable strings I listed all readable strings from the file searching for clues. I found a sentence and two words that didn’t point directly to the flag. The only obvious connection was between “defeat” and the string “Better luck next time”.\nChecking the program’s functions While reviewing the program’s functions, it became clear that the words found in the strings were part of the program flow. This suggested that the functions derrota() (defeat) and vitoria() (victory) would be relevant, and that vitoria() would likely return the flag.\nExecuting the functions Initially, I tried running the functions in debug mode but received a permission error. After adjusting the permissions/environment (allowing debugging/execution), I was able to call the functions.\nI had to deal with an unknown return type; to work around this, I treated the return as void temporarily to force execution. When running them:\nderrota() printed the same sentence found in the readable strings; vitoria() returned the flag. Interpretation / explanation The function derrota() simply returns the raw string stored inside the binary, which is why it was already visible in the readable strings. The vitoria() function, however, appears to perform some decoding process on previously stored data; when this routine executes, the flag is revealed.\n","date":"2025-11-20T00:00:00Z","image":"https://kauamoreno.dev/p/patch/banner_hu_210b449760968a72.jpeg","permalink":"https://kauamoreno.dev/p/patch/","title":"Patch"}]
